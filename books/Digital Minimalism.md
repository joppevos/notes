### Notes on digitial minimalism by Carl Newport

In essence, it is a book about the importance of reducing wasted leisure.
It questions whether or not a tool you use, like facebook is needed and lets you think about the real importance of it on your life.
A lot of people think facebook connects them, but you should question if it does and if there are better ways to connect.

Carl is not against using digital devices. He promotes using them optimized to the life you want to pursue.
There is a lot of overlap and connections to his other book "deepwork" that values high quality working time.

Text messaging is not sufficiently rich to fulfill the brains cravings for real conversations. A day of small talk over a chat service can 
leave you quite empty compared to a short good talk with a friend face-to-face or even over the phone.

_"Digital minimalism is a philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected
and optimized activities that strongly support the things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else."_

#### Ask the  following question
Is it the best way to use this technology to support my values? whenever it is browsing reddit, watching the news showing terrorism in Ghana etc.
Try to see how much time must be sacrificed to earn the rather small return. Is it once a week that you find a good article on Medium, 
but spend every morning browsing, reading, searching for it? Than maybe you should consider changing the habit to get the same return

#### Succesful social leisure
- Spend time with people in person. There is a richness in realworld encounters that is largely lost in virtual connections.
Slaying dragons with your internet buddy you have never met doesn't qualify.

- structure in the social interaction. Often a common shared goal/interest. ie Making a tree house when you where younger, fixing motorcycles when your older. 


#### Spend time alone
We need solitude to thrive as human beings. A number of import people in history have noted this.
In recent years without realizing we have been reducing this crucial ingredient from our lives.
Anxiety is an explosive sympton in the new generation, with a high chance that is it probably related to our brain
constant being wired. 
- **Be comfortable with doing nothing**
 
    Take a walk without a phone, look out the window when waiting in a queue. Don't grab your phone instantly when going to the toilet.
    These moments let your brain process and give you insight from your unconsciousness. Also proven to help with falling asleep and stress reduction 
    You can learn to enjoy being bored


_"I think i cannot preserve my health and spirit, unless a spend four hours a day at least, sauntering
through the woods and over the hills and fields, absolutely free from all the wordly engagements" - Thoreau_

#### Notes to self
Minimize mindless spotify use. No need to not leave the house without headphones and fire up a list skipping trough for the perfect track
Wear a watch, do not watch  phone for the time.
Block specific websites and set time limits.
